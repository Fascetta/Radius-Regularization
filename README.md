## Thesis Investigation for Bachelor's final in Applied Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence

As thesis topic I have a study on the calibration properties of hyperbolic neural networks. It involves replicating the results contained in this repo:

- <https://github.com/kschwethelm/HyperbolicCV?tab=readme-ov-file>

Just the ones regarding the Hybrid Poincar√© model. This should not require any training.
Then we should investigate the calibration properties of the network:

Computing the ECE score:

And see if these score correlates to the hyperbolic radius you can read about the meaning of the radius from here
