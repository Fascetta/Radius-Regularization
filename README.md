# CPHNN: Calibration Properties of Hyperbolic Neural Networks
## Introduction
This repository serves as the investigation for the Bachelor's final thesis in Applied Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence. The focus of this thesis is on studying the calibration properties of hyperbolic neural networks.


## Objective
The aim of this thesis study is to investigate the calibration properties of hyperbolic neural networks.

## Investigation
1. Replication of Results
We will replicate the results from the Hybrid Poincaré model described in the provided repository, specifically focusing on the Hybrid Poincaré model.

2. Calibration Property and Correlation Analysis
Once the replication is completed, we will proceed to investigate the calibration properties of the network. This will involve:

* Computing the Expected Calibration Error (ECE) score.
