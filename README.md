# CPHNN: Calibration Properties of Hyperbolic Neural Networks
## Introduction
This repository serves as the investigation for the Bachelor's final thesis in Applied Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence. The focus of this thesis is on studying the calibration properties of hyperbolic neural networks.

## Objective
The primary objective is to replicate the results presented in the repository HyperbolicCV, specifically those related to the Hybrid Poincaré model. This replication process does not require any additional training.

## Investigation
1. Replication of Results
We will replicate the results from the Hybrid Poincaré model described in the provided repository.

2. Calibration Property Analysis
Our investigation will focus on computing the Expected Calibration Error (ECE) score, as outlined in the paper Calibration Tests in Multi-class Classification: A unifying framework.

3. Correlation Analysis
We will explore the correlation between the ECE score and the hyperbolic radius, whose significance is detailed in the paper On Hyperbolic Neural Networks.

## Additional Resources
For further understanding of the hyperbolic radius and its implications, please refer to the provided paper.

## Conclusion
By conducting this investigation, we aim to contribute to the understanding of calibration properties in hyperbolic neural networks, shedding light on their effectiveness and potential applications.
